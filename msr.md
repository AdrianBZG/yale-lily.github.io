The MSR project focuses on developing novel techniques for text summarization. Previously, we worked on dialogue summarization and long-document summarization (see our previous papers: QMSum, Long-input Summ). As for this semester, we are working on three distinct directions: 1) Improving SummerTime, an open-source text summarization library we are building with 160+ stars and a demo paper; 2) Few-shot prompt learning for summarization, for which we will develop methods to adapt a pretrained model to a new domain with prompting methods; 3) A hybrid summarization dataset (in joint effort with the Table Summ project).
