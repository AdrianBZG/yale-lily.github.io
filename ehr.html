    <h2 class="post-title">NLP for Electronic Patient Records</h2>
  </header> 
We work with the Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation (CORE) at the School of Medicine at Yale, investigating the use of NLP on electronic health records.  The tasks include abbreviation disambiguation, patient digital pairs, patient history record summarization. We are interested in how to transfer general knowledge to the medical domain and how to take good advantage of the limited high-quality data. Besides, we are also developing an NLP toolkit for the medical domain to perform tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction.
