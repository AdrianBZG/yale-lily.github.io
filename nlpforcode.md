The NLP4Code project aims to study and develop deep learning methods for various tasks related to source code, including code generation, program synthesis, code translation, automatic program repair, code summarization, etc. An example application is Copilot, a GPT-3 model trained on all code on GitHub. For this semester, we will build a dataset that unifies previous semantic parsing datasets with different target languages (e.g., SQL, lambda-calculus, first order logic). By converting all of them into Python, we will be able to use the existing large pretrained code language models, such as GPT-Neo, GPT-J and Codex to approach universal semantic parsing (i.e., parse all NL to Python).
