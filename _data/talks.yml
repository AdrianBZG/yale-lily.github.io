    - title: "Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech" 
      speaker: "Jesse Shapiro"
      abstract: "We study trends in the partisanship of congressional speech from 1873 to 2016. We define partisanship to be the ease with which an observer could infer a congressperson’s party from a fixed amount of speech, and we estimate it using a structural choice model and methods from machine learning. Our method corrects a severe finite-sample bias that we show arises with standard estimators. The results reveal that partisanship is far greater in recent years than in the past, and that it increased sharply in the early 1990s after remaining low and relatively constant over the preceding century. Our method is applicable to the study of high-dimensional choices in many domains, and we illustrate its broader utility with an application to residential segregation."

    - title: "The Human Components of Machine Learning" 
      speaker: "Jenn Wortman Vaughan"
      abstract: "Machine learning is often viewed as an automated process. Data is fed to a learning algorithm that outputs a trained model which then makes predictions. In practice, however it is common for every step of this process to rely on humans in the loop. Training data is often generated through human activity, either as passive observations of social processesor actively crowdsourced annotations. Humans prepare this data for use by the algorithm, engineer features, and tweak the algorithm’s parameters to fit their needs. And in many applications to medicine, criminal justice, and other critical domains, humans must interpret the learned model’s predictions to determine how to best make use of these predictions in their own decision making process. In this talk, I’ll argue for the importance of understanding the humans in the loop. As one example, I’ll describe some of my own research on crowdsourcing aimed at understanding who the crowd is, what motivates them, and how they communicate. I’ll also touch on a new direction of research that I’m particularly excited about, studying how to make machine learning human-interpretable, and what human interpretability even means."

      bio: Jenn Wortman Vaughan is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research, New York City. She studies algorithmic economics, machine learning, and social computing, often in the conext of prediction markets, crowdsourcing, and other human-in-the-loop systems. Jenn came to MSR in 2012 from UCLA, where she was an assistant professor in the computer science department. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, and subsequently spent a year as a Computing Innovation Fellow at Harvard. She is the recipient of Penn's 2009Rubinoff dissertation award for innovative applications of computer technology, a National Science Foundation CAREER award, a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), and a handful of best paper or best student paper awards. In her "spare" time, Jenn is involved in a variety of efforts to provide support for women in computer science; most notably, she co-founded the Annual Workshop for Women in Machine Learning, which has been held each year since 2006.
