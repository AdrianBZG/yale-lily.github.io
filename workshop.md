<h2>Registration Is Now Closed</h2>
Thanks for your interest. We're filled to capacity, so the workshop registration is now closed.
 -->
<!-- <h2>Introduction</h2>
For the last 3 years we have had a big success with the University of
Michigan Workshop on Data Mining.  We
uncovered lots of people at Michigan doing interesting and unexpected
things with data.  The set of people doing this work is only growing, so
let's get together and again share our work with each other.
 -->

<!--
The format will be roughly similar to last year: a series of 20-minute
presentations by UM faculty and researchers, plus some panels and a
student poster session. In addition, we would like to have a series of
tutorials for data mining tools, especially those that are novel or
unique to Michigan.
<p>
The first order of business is in finding people interested in giving
a presentation on their research. If you:

<ul>
<li> Presented last year and have new results
<li> Didn't present, but wish you had
<li> Have a new application or technique to share
<li> Have a new system or piece of software to discuss
</ul>
<p>
Then please let us know if you are interested in giving a
presentation. If you would like to attend but not present, please also
let us know. Finally, please let us know if you have ideas for panels
or any other suggestions.
<p>
One last point: please forward to your local department's
announcements. We're interested in hearing from a large number of
people.

-->
<!-- 
<h2>Who is invited?</h2>
All UM faculty, staff, and graduate students working in the fields of
data mining, broadly construed.  We are interested in techniques: models and technologies for
statistical data analysis, Web search technology, analysis of user
behavior, data visualization, etc. We are also interested in
data-centric applications to problems in your own field,
whether it is in the natural sciences, the social sciences, or something else.
External visitors from the State of Michigan and beyond are also welcome to
attend. -->

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The workshop will be held at Luce Hall <a href="http://conferencesandevents.yale.edu/campus/venues/luce-hall" target="_blank"></a> at Yale University. The address is 34 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511. </p>

Parking Info</h2>
<p>Parking is available near the Beyster Building but is in short demand because of nearby construction. This map shows available parking that is near the building. Areas marked in blue on the map below require a U-M blue pass or a U-M visitor parking pass. Red areas are metered parking. </p>
<p>Visitor parking passes are available only for those attendees who are external to the University and who requested a pass during registration. If this is you, please park and come into the building and to the registration table in Tishman Hall, the first floor of the atrium in the Beyster Building, in order to pick up your pass. </p>

    <i>Abstract:</i>
    Media can be loosely defined as the ecosystem that distributes entertainment and information about the world in a timely manner to the mass public. The modern Media ecosystem has been focused on 'mass audiences' for two reasons: 1) it is expensive and time consuming to produce and distribute niche media, and 2) revenue within the ecosystem flows from advertisers/marketers who have been trained to think at the mass audience level. In this talk, we briefly outline the differences between the digital media ecosystem and the traditional media ecosystem, and how this led to a change in how Media was delivered. We then motivate the need to move away from the old view of media audiences to a view of an audience-of-one in which automated personalization becomes a key piece connecting users to the products they use. Finally, we discuss the scale of the personalization problem across Media and detail what Yahoo! is currently doing to deliver true personalization at scale to their users.

  <li><strong>March 12, 2013</strong> The workshop will comprise a series of 25-minute talks, plus a student poster session. We may also be able to have a small number of extended talks for topics that have especially broad appeal.<p> -->

<!-- Our immediate goal is to find a set of interesting speakers. We would like to have speakers from across many different departments on campus. Accordingly, we ask speakers to present a talk that will be interesting to a diverse audience.<p>

If you are interested in giving a talk, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10PeC1vkCVax6Pam5ciEZ6bmG1QVnOJ_0VVD8G-RkJ74/viewform" target="_blank">please fill out this short form</a>.<p>

If you have presented in the past but have new results you'd like to discuss, please go ahead and fill out the form. Although we expect most presenters will be affiliated with the University of Michigan, we are very interested in hearing from local industry and other universities in the area.<p> -->
